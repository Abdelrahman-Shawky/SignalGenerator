# Signal Generator

A matlab applicaton that generates a signal according to user input and prompts user for further operation on signal.

# What I Learned

* Plotting of signals in the time domain with the use of linspace function.
* Different signal defintions and plotting.
* Plotting polynomials using polyval function.
* Manipulating signals by performing several operations on them.

# User Manual

* User is asked for sampling frequency, start, end, number of break points.
* Positions of break points are entered.
* Type of signal for each section is entered (DC, Ramp, Polynomial, Exp, Sinusoidal).
* Signal is displayed.
* User is asked if any operation is needed to be performed.
* Operation of choice is selected (Amp Scaling, Time Shift, Expanding, Compressing, Original, None).
* New signal is displayd.
